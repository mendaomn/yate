# Yet Another Test Framework (and assertions)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mendaomn/yate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mendaomn/yate)

Inspired by [Kent C. Dodds testing-workshop](), I've decided to code my own little test framework, mimicking the Jest API, in order to better understand how things work under the hood.

This project includes:

- `test` function
- `expect.toBe` and `expect.toEqual` assertions
- `spy` function to create a mocked function
